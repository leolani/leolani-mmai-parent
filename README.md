# leolani-mmai-parent

Parent repository for the Leolani App. This repository uses Python 3.9.

This repository contains all components of the Leolani app as _git_ submodules and can be used as the root to
execute [build commands](https://github.com/leolani/cltl-build/tree/main/make) that are run on the components.

For a description of the Leolani App see to the [README](https://github.com/leolani/cltl-leolani-app) there.

## Check-out

To check out all code needed for the Leolani App, clone this repository including all submodules:

        git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/leolani/leolani-mmai-parent.git

Checkout the current state of the parent

        git checkout --recurse-submodules

Update to the current branch heads of the submodules:

        git submodule update --remote

To pull the latest changes, you can run:

        git pull --recurse-submodules

To push some submodule changes, go to the submodule folder and push like:

        git push origin HEAD:main

## Run the application

Checkout the repository as described in [Check-out](#check-out). Then go to the repository root, build the project,
activate the virtual environment for the Python application and run it. Altogether:

        git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/leolani/leolani-mmai-parent.git
        cd leolani-mmai-parent
        make build
        cd cltl-leolani-app
        source venv/bin/activate
        cd py-app
        python app.py

You can then go to the chat interface [here](http://0.0.0.0:8000/chatui/static/chat.html) to type and see what the
system hears. You can also see what the systems sees [here](http://0.0.0.0:8000/monitoring/static/monitoring.html).

NOTES:

- The `make build` may take 5 - 10 min
- Remember to launch GraphDB and have a repository called 'sandbox'
- Remember to launch Docker before running
- Remember to use the virtual environment (created by the `make build`command) located at `cltl-leolani-app/venv`

### Run in the robot

Please go to `cltl-leolani-app/py-app/config/default.config` and change

* the `server_image_url` and `server_audio_url` fields under `[cltl.backend]`
* the `remote_url` field under `[cltl.backend.text_output]`
* Get wireless internet on your laptop (eg, eduroam), and connect with a wire to the PepperLinkSyss modem
* Get your ip as such `ipconfig getifaddr en7` (eg, 192.168.1.192)

## Troubleshooting

- Bad initialization of Git Submodules: Usually, if running the `make build` command fails and complains about missing
  makefiles the git submodule checkout didnâ€™t work properly. You will need to go to the specific submodule and run the
  checkout in that folder. For example, the error:

  ``` bash
  error: util/make/makefile.parent.mk:57: /YOUR_PATH/leolani-mmai-parent/cltl-face-recognition/makefile.d: No such file or directory
  ```

  Would need to got to the `face-recognition` module and run:

  ``` bash 
  cd cltl-face-recognition
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

- Unable to pull due to unwanted changes: Sometimes when running `git pull --recurse-submodules` you may get an error as
  such:

  ```bash
  error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
          VERSION
  
  ```

  For which you have to stash all changes in each submodule. You can use the following command

  ```bash
  git submodule foreach 'git stash'
  ```

- Dependency errors: Sometimes there are versioning problems among the submodules or packages required for the app. This
  might look like this:

  ```bash
  INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of cltl-reply-generation[service] to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
  ERROR: Cannot install cltl.reply-generation because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
  ```

  In this case removing the cache helps. You can do it like so:

  ```bash 
  pip cache purge
  ```

- Direct fetching of a commit in a submodule fails: Sometimes the submodules are unable to pull the latest changes as it
  cannot find a specific commit. Therror looks like this:

  ```bash
  Fetched in submodule path 'cltl-about-agent', but it did not contain 017668c1d9dbb36c858fa803fd6285e1236c7d38. Direct fetching of that commit failed.
  ```

  For this you can force the initialization of the submodules as follows:

  ```bash
  git submodule update --force --recursive --init --remote
  ```

- Make build: Sometimes, you will need to run `make build` twice, as some errors get fixed only through the first run.
  Some other times you need to first run `make clean` and then `make build`.

- Docker already running: Sometimes when you kill (not stop) an application, the docker images will not close correctly.
  You might need to stop them manually.
